//(Exception: if the compiler-generated bookkeeping functions (destructor, copy constructor, and assignment operator) don't do the right thing, declare and implement your own.) You may add any private data members and private member functions you like to those classes. You may add protected member functions to those classes if you wish, but you must not add any protected data members. (We haven't talked about protected members in this course.) The word friend must not appear in your program.
//The Board class is responsible for maintaining the board. A Board object knows about the holes, pots, and beans. For those functions that talk about specific holes, the holes are indicated by a Side and hole number. The holes are numbered as indicated in the diagrams above; a pot is considered hole #0. Thus, North's hole #1 is next to North's pot; South's hole #6 is next to South's pot. Notice that this numbering of holes is an aspect of the class's interface and our test code will depend on it. Of course, your implementations of the functions are free to map that numbering scheme into something more convenient for their internal use.

 //If the indicated hole is invalid or beans is negative, this function returns false without changing anything. Otherwise, it will return true after setting the number of beans in the indicated hole or pot to the value of the third parameter. (This could change what beansInPlay and totalBeans return if they are called later.) This function exists solely so that we and you can more easily test your program: None of your code that implements the member functions of any class is allowed to call this function directly or indirectly. (We'll show an example of its use below.)
